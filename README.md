#LRUChat

Developed a chat application with a chat list using an LRU Cache mechanism, seamlessly managing insertion, deletion, and search operations for efficient handling of messages. The implementation leverages a combination of a Doubly Linked List and a Hash Map, ensuring constant-time performance. Incoming messages update the chat list, placing new conversations at the top and repositioning existing ones for optimal accessibility.
